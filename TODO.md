# TODO
- [] store values inside objects
- [] call methods on objects
    - must pass object as `self` local
- [] generation of loops
    - loop, while, repeat ...
- [] evaluate if async-await could be supported (*complex topic for later*)
    - besides instructions, interrupts could be an option
    - would require own scheduler
